@example The following example will search a given array for the last occurrence of age that is over 25.
<p>The result does not return the position of the found element, only the element itself.</p>
<pre>
Private Sub Main()
    Dim Ages() As Long
    Dim Age As Long
    
    Ages = NewLongs(14, 22, 31, 27, 18)
    
    '' To find the last age over 25, pass the array and
    '' address of the callback method to CorArray.FindLast.
    Age = CorArray.FindLast(Ages, AddressOf AgeOver25)
    
    '' Dispay the the last age over 25 found.
    Debug.Print "The last age over 25 found: " & Age
End Sub

'' The method accepts a ByRef parameter of the array element type.
Private Function AgeOver25(ByRef Age As Long) As Boolean
    AgeOver25 = Age > 25
End Function

'' This code example produces the following output.
''    The last age over 25 found: 27
