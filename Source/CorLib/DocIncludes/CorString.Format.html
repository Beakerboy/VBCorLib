@remarks Formatting is performed by inserting argument values into indexed locations within the supplied formatting string.
To indicate the index for an argument to be inserted into the string, a pair of curly braces encloses the index value ''{n}'.
The indexes begin at zero. So the first argument can be referenced with ''{0}' in the formatting string. The braces and index
value will be replaced with the argument at index 0 in the list. 
<p>Additional formatting information can be supplied along with the index to further customize how the argument is to be formatted as a string. A colon is used to indicate additional formatting information ''{0:n}'. In this case the 'n' indicates that value should be formatted as a numeric value.</p>
