@example
The following code uses the callback <b>Person18OrOlder</b> with the <b>Exists</b> method to search an array of <b>Long</b>s.
The callback method is passed individual values representing a person's age and returns <b>True</b> if the age is of an
adult or <b>False</b> if not.
<pre>
Public Sub Main()
    Dim Ages() As Long
    Dim Found As Boolean
    
    Ages = NewLongs(4, 16, 10, 22, 14, 19)
    
    Found = CorArray.Exists(Ages, AddressOf Person18OrOlder)
    
    Debug.Print "There is at least one adult: " & Found
End Sub

Private Function Person18OrOlder(ByRef Age As Long) As Boolean
    Person18OrOlder = Age >= 18
End Function

'' The code example produces the following output.
''  There is at least one adult: True
